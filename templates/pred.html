    <h1>Patient has Stroke</h1>
    <h2>Causes</h2>
    <h3>Stroke happens when a blood clot blocks the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain.The main 
      cause of stroke is high blood pressure, which can weaken the arteries in the brain 
      and make them more likely to split or rupture.
      Things that increase the risk of high blood pressure include: </h3>
      
      <h3>1.Being overweight</h3>
      <h3>2.Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol</h3>
      <h3>3.Smoking</h3>
      <h3>4.Lack of exercise</h3>
      <h3>5.Stress</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Reducing the risk of a stroke</h2>
  <h3>It's not possible to completely prevent strokes because some things that increase your risk of the condition cannot be changed.
    But it's possible to significantly reduce your risk of having a stroke by making lifestyle changes to avoid problems such as atherosclerosis and high blood pressure.
    You should also seek medical advice if you think you may have an irregular heartbeat.</h3>
